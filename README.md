## üìñ Introduction

ScaleX brings cutting-edge AI face restoration to your command line. Whether you're dealing with old family photos, blurry portraits, or low-resolution images, ScaleX aims to revitalize them with remarkable clarity and detail. It intelligently combines face-specific enhancement using **GFPGAN** models with optional background upscaling via **Real-ESRGAN**.

This project focuses on delivering a refined and accessible experience by:

- Upgrading the core to **Python 3.12**.
- Providing an **enhanced CLI** with clear options and rich progress feedback (thanks to Typer and Rich).
- Automating fixes for common **dependency issues**.
- Streamlining **model downloads** with user-friendly progress bars.

### üöÄ Automated Installation (Recommended)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Md-Siam-Mia-Code/ScaleX-CLI.git
    cd ScaleX-CLI
    ```

2.  **Run the Installation Script:**
    The scripts will guide you through creating a Conda environment, choosing a PyTorch version (CPU/GPU), and installing all dependencies.

    - **For Windows:**
      Open a Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell in the `ScaleX-CLI` directory and run:

      ```batch
      install_scalex_windows.bat
      ```

    - **For Linux / macOS:**
      Open your terminal in the `ScaleX-CLI` directory, make the script executable, then run it:
      `bash
    chmod +x install_scalex.sh
    ./install_scalex_linux.sh
    `
      Follow the on-screen prompts provided by the script.

### üî© Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up the environment manually:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Md-Siam-Mia-Code/ScaleX-CLI.git
    cd ScaleX-CLI
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate Conda Environment:**

    ```bash
    conda create -n ScaleX-CLI python=3.12 -y
    conda activate ScaleX-CLI
    ```

3.  **Install PyTorch:**
    Visit the [PyTorch official website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to get the correct `conda install` command for your system (OS, package manager, CUDA version if applicable).

    _Example for CPU-only (conda):_

    ```bash
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch -y
    ```

    _Example for CUDA (conda):_

    ```bash
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=<your-cuda-version> -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
    ```

    _(Adjust the CUDA version as needed for your setup)_

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
5.  **Model Downloads:**
    üöÄ _Required models (GFPGAN, Real-ESRGAN, facexlib components) will be automatically downloaded with a progress bar when you run the application for the first time if they are not found in the `models/pretrained/` directory._

## üíª Usage

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running ScaleX

After successful installation:

1.  Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt.
2.  Activate the Conda environment: `conda activate ScaleX-CLI`
3.  Navigate to the `ScaleX-CLI` directory.
4.  Run the main script `inference_scalex.py`.

**Basic Command Structure:**

```bash
python inference_scalex.py --input <path_to_input> --output <path_to_output_folder> [OPTIONS]
```

**Example:**
To process all images in a folder named `MyPhotos` and save results to `EnhancedPhotos`, using GFPGAN v1.4, RealESRGAN x4 for background, and upscaling the final image by 4x:

````bash
python inference_scalex.py -i MyPhotos/ -o EnhancedPhotos/ -f v1.4 -b x4 -s 4
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Options
*   `-i, --input PATH`: **Required.** Path to your input image or a folder containing images.
*   `-o, --output PATH`: Folder where results will be saved. (Default: `results_scalex`)
*   `-f, --face-enhance [v1.3|v1.4]`: Choose the GFPGAN model for face restoration. (Default: `v1.4`)
*   `-b, --bg-enhance [none|x2|x4]`: Background enhancement model.
    *   `none`: No background processing.
    *   `x2`: RealESRGAN x2plus.
    *   `x4`: RealESRGAN x4plus.
    (Default: `x2`)
*   `-s, --upscale INTEGER`: The final desired upscaling factor for the *entire image*. (Default: `2`)
*   `--bg-tile INTEGER`: Tile size for background upsampler to manage memory. 0 disables tiling. (Default: `400`)
*   `--device [auto|cpu|cuda|mps]`: Select computation device. (Default: `auto`)
*   `--aligned`: Use this if your input images are already 512x512 aligned faces.
*   `--ext [auto|png|jpg]`: Extension for saved output images. (Default: `auto`)
*   `--no-save-cropped`: Do not save the initial cropped faces.
*   `--no-save-restored`: Do not save the individually restored faces.
*   `--no-save-comparison`: Do not save the side-by-side comparison images.

## üí° Troubleshooting

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torchvision.transforms.functional_tensor'`**:
  ScaleX includes an automated patch (`patches.py`) for this common `basicsr`/`torchvision` issue. It should be applied automatically. If you see this, ensure `patches.py` is present and correctly imported at the start of `inference_scalex.py`.
- **Model Download Issues**:
  - Check your internet connection.
  - If a download seems stuck or corrupt, try deleting the specific `.pth` file from the `models/pretrained/` directory within your ScaleX project folder and re-run.
- **GPU (CUDA / MPS) Errors**:
  - **NVIDIA CUDA:** Ensure your NVIDIA drivers are up-to-date and that you installed the PyTorch version matching your system's CUDA toolkit version.
  - **Apple MPS:** Ensure you are on a compatible macOS and PyTorch version.
  - Test with `--device cpu` to isolate if the problem is GPU-specific.
- **Installation Script Issues**:
  - Ensure Conda is installed and its `bin` or `Scripts` directory is in your system's PATH, or that Conda has been initialized for your shell (e.g., via `conda init bash` or `conda init cmd.exe`).
- **Other `ModuleNotFoundError`s**:
  Make sure you have activated the correct conda environment (`conda activate ScaleX-CLI`) and that all packages from `requirements.txt` were installed successfully.
